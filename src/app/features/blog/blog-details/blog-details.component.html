        <p>If you've ever spent time searching for a company's logo, brand colors, or social media links, you know how frustrating and time-consuming it can be. That's why we created Marketify — a simple yet powerful tool that helps you get all the important brand details using just a website link.
With Marketify, all you need is a company's domain name, like nike.com or apple.com. In seconds, you'll get access to their official logo (in SVG or PNG), brand colors, fonts, social media profiles, and even a short company description. Whether you're a developer building an app, a designer creating a presentation, or a marketer managing client content, Marketify makes your job faster and easier.
What makes Marketify different is its speed and simplicity. It's built using Java and Angular, which means it's reliable and developer-friendly. You can explore brands through a clean web interface or use our easy-to-integrate API to automate everything in your own application. You'll also get access to a personal dashboard where you can manage your API key and track usage.
Compared to other tools like Brandfetch, Marketify gives you more flexibility and control. You can even suggest or manage your own brand data, making it great for agencies and platforms that deal with multiple brands every day.
Getting started with Marketify is simple. Just visit marketify.io, sign up for a free account, and start searching by domain. Within minutes, you'll have all the brand details you need at your fingertips.
Marketify is built to save you time and help you create faster — whether you're pulling logos for a pitch deck or populating your CRM with brand info. Give it a try and see how easy brand access can be.</p>
