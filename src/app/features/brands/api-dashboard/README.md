# API Dashboard Implementation

This document outlines the new API Dashboard implementation that provides a modern, user-friendly interface for managing API keys and viewing dashboard statistics.

## Overview

The API Dashboard is a new feature that replaces the old Account Hub with a more focused, streamlined interface for API management. It provides:

- **Dashboard Overview**: Statistics, recent projects, and API key management
- **API Key Creation**: Simplified form for creating new API keys
- **API Key Management**: View, edit, and manage existing API keys
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with theme support

## Key Features

### 1. Dashboard Overview
- **Statistics Cards**: API calls, active projects, brands added, remaining quota
- **Recent Projects**: List of recent projects with status indicators
- **API Key Management**: Quick overview of API keys with usage statistics
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### 2. API Key Creation
- **Simplified Form**: Clean, step-by-step form for creating API keys
- **Rate Limit Tiers**: Visual selection of rate limit tiers
- **Permission Scopes**: Organized permission selection with descriptions
- **Security Features**: Expiration dates, environment selection
- **Success State**: Clear display of created API key with copy functionality

### 3. Services
- **ApiDashboardService**: Manages dashboard data and statistics
- **ApiKeyService**: Handles API key CRUD operations
- **MockDataService**: Provides mock data for development and testing

### 4. Models
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Consistent API**: Standardized models across the application
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new fields and features

## Routing

The new API Dashboard is accessible via the following routes:

- `/brands/api-dashboard` - Main dashboard
- `/brands/api-dashboard/api-keys/create` - Create new API key
- `/brands/api-dashboard/api-keys/manage` - Manage existing API keys
- `/brands/api-dashboard/api-keys/:id` - View API key details

## Navigation

The API Dashboard has been added to the main navigation under the "Brand" section with a "NEW" badge to highlight the new feature.

## Backward Compatibility

The old Account Hub routes are maintained for backward compatibility:
- `/brands/account-hub` - Legacy account hub
- `/brands/account-hub/api-keys/*` - Legacy API key routes

## Theme Support

The API Dashboard fully supports the application's theme system:
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Automatic theme switching
- **CSS Variables**: Uses theme-aware CSS variables
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant with proper ARIA labels

## Development

### Mock Data
During development, the services use mock data to simulate API responses. This allows for:
- **Offline Development**: Work without backend connectivity
- **Consistent Testing**: Predictable data for testing
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick iteration on UI/UX

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Component and service tests included
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and handling

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to "Brand" > "API Dashboard" in the main navigation
2. View dashboard statistics and recent projects
3. Create new API keys using the "Create API Key" button
4. Manage existing API keys from the dashboard or dedicated management page

### For Developers
1. Import the necessary services in your components
2. Use the provided models for type safety
3. Follow the established patterns for new features
4. Add tests for new functionality

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed API usage analytics
- **Webhook Management**: Configure and manage webhooks
- **Team Management**: Multi-user API key management
- **Advanced Security**: IP whitelisting, domain restrictions
- **API Documentation**: Integrated API documentation viewer

## Migration Notes

When migrating from the old Account Hub:
1. Update any hardcoded routes to use the new API Dashboard routes
2. Update navigation links to point to the new dashboard
3. Test all API key management functionality
4. Verify theme compatibility and responsive behavior

## Support

For questions or issues related to the API Dashboard:
1. Check the component documentation and comments
2. Review the test files for usage examples
3. Consult the service implementations for API details
4. Follow the established patterns in the codebase
